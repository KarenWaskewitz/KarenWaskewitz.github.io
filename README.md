## Let me tell you more about myself...

  1. I'm a sience teacher
  2. I do my PhD at the Science Teaching Department
  3. I'm not born in Israel

## What I am working on right now...

For students it is very *difficult* to come up with **mechanistic explanations** in science classes. So we are trying to come up with a concept that helps students *understand those mechanisms* e.g. in biology and *enable them to explain* them.

## Why did I submit this homepage late?

a) My son got sick

b) I checked the instruction only today

c) I work more efficiently under pressure
