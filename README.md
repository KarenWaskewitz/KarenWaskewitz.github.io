# Welcome
This is my very first website on github

---

## Let me tell me more about myself...

  1. I'm a sience teacher
  2. I do my PhD at the Science Teaching Department
  3. I'm not born in Israel

## What I am working on right now...

For students it is very difficult to come up with mechanistic explanations in science classes. So we are trying to come up with a concept that helps students understand those mechanisms e.g. in biology and enable them to explain them.

## Why did I submit this homepage late?

a) My son got sick
b) I checked the instuction only today
c) I work more efficiently under pressure
